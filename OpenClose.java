// 2. Open Close Principle

// Open close principle states that the code should be open for extension but closed for modification.

// This means that a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself.

// Extending the Code: Why It Doesnâ€™t Follow OCP

// Refactoring the Code to Follow OCP

// To follow the open close principle, we can refactor the code by creating an Invoice interface and implementing it in the Invoice class.
// We can then create a new class, InternationalInvoice, that extends the Invoice class and implements the generateInvoice method for international invoices.

        invoiceGenerator.generateInvoice(amount);
    }

    public void applyDiscount() {
        System.out.println("Discount applied");

// How does this follow the open close principle?

// The InvoiceGenerator interface is open for extension, as we can create new classes that implement the interface.
